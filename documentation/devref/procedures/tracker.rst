Issue Tracker
=============

We keep track of bug reports and feature requests using the
`Github repository issue tracker <https://github.com/transientskp/tkp/issues>`_.

We use the issue tracker extensively for project planning and managing
releases. It is not a *hard* requirement that every commit to the repository
refers to a particular issue, but you are strongly encouraged to record your
activities on the tracker and to refer to it in commit messages as
appropriate.
