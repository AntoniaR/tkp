WCSTools: libwcstools

Run "make" to build a "libwcstools" shared library on OS X (.dylib) or Linux
(.so) (or possibly elsewhere; untested). Then dump it on a path that ctypes
can find for use in the tkp_lib/coordinates.py routines.

This code is based on WCSTools release 3.7.4: see details below.

WCSTools libwcs.a

These subroutines support the programs in the WCSTools package and include
catalog search engines, image manipulation software, and fitting software.
There use is documented on the World Wide Web at

    http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/wcstools/

Information about the individual files is in the Subroutines file.
A self-contained subset of these programs which deal with image world
coordinate systems is separately available and is used by the SAOimage,
SAOtng, Skycat, and DS9 image display programs:

  cel.c dsspos.c fitshead.h fitsfile.c fitsfile.h hget.c hput.c iget.c
  imhfile.c imio.c lin.c platepos.c proj.c slasubs.c sph.c tnxpos.c
  wcs.c wcs.h wcscon.c wcslib.c wcslib.h wcstrig.c worldpos.c dateutil.c
