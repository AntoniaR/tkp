LOFAR Transients Pipeline
=========================

*NOTE:* This project is not public until the `TraP paper`_ has been submitted,
at which point we will release it under the terms described below. Until then,
it should *not* be redistributed.

The LOFAR Transients Pipeline (or "TraP") is a Python and SQL based system for
detecting and responding to transient and variable sources in a stream of
astronomical images. It primarily targets LOFAR data, but is also applicable
to a range of other instruments.  See the `pipeline documentation`_ for
details including installation instructions and a usage guide.

TraP development is coordinated by `The LOFAR Transients Key Science Project`_.

Bug tracking and feature requests are handled through the `LOFAR Project Issue
Tracker`_. Contributions are welcome.
