LOFAR Transients Pipeline
=========================

The LOFAR Transients Pipeline (or "TraP") is a Python and SQL based system for
detecting and responding to transient and variable sources in a stream of
astronomical images. It primarily targets LOFAR data, but is also applicable
to a range of other instruments.  See the `pipeline documentation`_ for
details including installation instructions and a usage guide.

An overview of the TraP will be published in the forthcoming `TraP paper`_
(currently undergoing journal review),
and we already have an assigned ASCL ID (http://ascl.net/1412.011).


TraP development is coordinated by `The LOFAR Transients Key Science Project`_.

Bug tracking and feature requests are handled through the repository `issue
tracker`_. Contributions are welcome.

This is open source software: see ``COPYING`` for licensing and copyright
