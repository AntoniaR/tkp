I added this to the repository in the hopes that it would inspire a test.  
I spoke with Joe Lazio (NRL) about RFI issues.  He said that he discussed this with a computation person he knows and they used a machine learning algorithm to find rfi.  Their tests were simple, but it suggests that machine learning could be used this way.  The data in this directory is the same used in that test.  The values show data amplitude as a function of frequency and time;  this is for one baseline of a VLA observation.
Could we reproduce their test with this data?  Joe says the c code can be used to read the data.
